# Ping-Pong-By-Eeshan-Prabhu

The **Python Ping Pong Game** is a simple yet engaging two-player arcade-style game **created using Python**. The project utilizes the **Turtle graphics library** **for visual elements and the Random module to introduce unpredictability in ball movement**. The game provides a classic and entertaining experience, allowing two players to compete against each other.


**Game Elements:**

1. **Ball:**
   - The "ball.py" file contains the code for the game ball. The ball moves dynamically across the screen, bouncing off walls and paddles.
   -  The Random module is employed to add an element of unpredictability to the ball's trajectory, enhancing the game's excitement.

2. **Paddles:**
   - Player one controls their paddle using the 'W' and 'S' keys, while player two controls theirs using the up and down arrow keys.
   -  The paddles are crucial for deflecting the ball and preventing it from reaching the edge of the screen.

3. **Scoreboard:**
   - The "scoreboard.py" file manages the scoring system for the game.
   -  It keeps track of each player's score and updates the display accordingly. Points are scored when the opponent fails to hit the ball with their paddle.

4. **Screen:**
   - The game screen is coded in a separate file, providing the framework for the entire game.
   -  It initializes the Turtle screen, sets the background, and manages the game loop, ensuring smooth gameplay.

**Controls:**
- Player 1: 'W' (Move paddle up), 'S' (Move paddle down)
- Player 2: Up Arrow (Move paddle up), Down Arrow (Move paddle down)

**Files:**
1. **ball.py:** Contains the ball class and its movement logic.
   
2. **scoreboard.py:** Manages the scoring system and display.
   
3. **screen.py:** Initializes the game screen and controls the main game loop.
